# Audio2DTX Instrument Detection Improvement Plan

## Current Problem Analysis

The current system has several issues with instrument detection:
- **Confusion between snare and kick drums**: The frequency-based classification is not reliable enough
- **False tom detections**: The system detects toms where there shouldn't be any
- **Magenta integration helps slightly but not enough**: The current hybrid approach still falls short of good quality

## Proposed Improvement Tracks

### Track 1: **Original Audio vs. Drum Stems** üéµ
**Hypothesis**: Using original audio instead of Spleeter-separated drum stems might provide better instrument classification.

**Reasoning**: 
- Spleeter separation may introduce artifacts that confuse the classifier
- Original audio contains more harmonic context that could help distinguish instruments
- Drum separation might reduce the signal quality and lose important transient information

**Implementation**: 
- Create a new processing mode that uses original audio directly
- Compare classification results between original and separated audio
- Test both onset detection and instrument classification on original audio

**Expected Impact**: Potentially 15-20% improvement in classification accuracy

### Track 2: **LSTM + Self-Attention Model** üß†
**Hypothesis**: Replace the current TensorFlow model with a state-of-the-art LSTM + self-attention architecture.

**Reasoning**:
- Recent 2024 research shows LSTM models achieve 77-87% accuracy on drum datasets
- Self-attention mechanisms can capture global repetitive structures in drum patterns
- Current model might be too simple for complex drum patterns

**Implementation**:
- Implement a bidirectional LSTM with 128 units + multi-head self-attention
- Train on larger datasets (E-GMD, MDB-Drums, IDMT-SMT)
- Use tatum-synchronous encoding for better temporal alignment

**Expected Impact**: 30-40% improvement in classification accuracy

---

### Track 3: **Simplified Single-Method Approach** ‚ö°
**Hypothesis**: The current weighted voting system creates confusion - focusing on one optimized method might be better.

**Reasoning**:
- Current hybrid approach (40% Magenta, 30% features, 30% context) may be diluting good predictions
- Complex voting can amplify errors instead of reducing them
- A single, well-optimized method might be more reliable

**Implementation**:
- Test the magenta method individually and create optimized version
- Compare with current hybrid approach

**Expected Impact**: 20-30% improvement in consistency and reliability

---

### Track 4: **Advanced Spectral Features + Context** üî¨
**Hypothesis**: Better feature extraction and contextual analysis can improve the frequency-based classifier.

**Reasoning**:
- Current 47-feature approach might not capture the most discriminative features
- Temporal context (beat position, previous instruments) is underutilized
- Modern spectral analysis techniques could be more effective

**Implementation**:
- Implement mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) variations
- Add beat-synchronous feature extraction
- Improve contextual pattern recognition (kick-snare alternation, etc.)
- Use more sophisticated decision trees or neural networks for classification

**Expected Impact**: 25-35% improvement in frequency-based classification

---

### Track 5: **Multi-Scale Temporal Analysis** ‚è∞
**Hypothesis**: Analyzing audio at multiple time scales can improve both onset detection and instrument classification.

**Reasoning**:
- Different drum instruments have different temporal characteristics
- Current 50ms window might not be optimal for all instruments
- Multi-scale analysis can capture both fast transients and longer decay characteristics

**Implementation**:
- Use windows of 25ms, 50ms, 100ms, and 200ms
- Implement separate classifiers for each scale
- Combine results using learned weights for each instrument class

**Expected Impact**: 20-30% improvement in onset detection and classification

---

### Track 6: **Real-Time Few-Shot Learning** üöÄ
**Hypothesis**: Adapt the model to the specific audio being processed using few-shot learning techniques.

**Reasoning**:
- Each song has unique recording characteristics and drum sounds
- The model could learn the specific drum kit characteristics during processing
- 2024 research shows promise for real-time adaptation

**Implementation**:
- Implement dynamic few-shot learning during processing
- Use the most confident predictions to adapt the model
- Create instrument-specific adaptation strategies

**Expected Impact**: 15-25% improvement in song-specific accuracy

---

### Track 7: **Ensemble of Specialized Models** üéØ
**Hypothesis**: Train separate models for different instrument groups instead of one multi-class model.

**Reasoning**:
- Kick vs. snare distinction requires different features than cymbal classification
- Specialized models can focus on the most discriminative features for each task
- Binary classifiers often perform better than multi-class ones

**Implementation**:
- Create separate models for: kick/snare, cymbals (hi-hat/crash/ride), toms
- Use hierarchical classification: first detect broad categories, then specific instruments
- Combine results using confidence-based voting

**Expected Impact**: 25-35% improvement in overall classification accuracy

---

### Track 8: **Data Augmentation and Preprocessing** üîÑ
**Hypothesis**: Better data preprocessing and augmentation can improve the robustness of all methods.

**Reasoning**:
- Current preprocessing might not be optimal for all audio types
- Data augmentation can make the model more robust to variations
- Better normalization and noise reduction can improve feature quality

**Implementation**:
- Implement advanced audio preprocessing (spectral subtraction, dynamic range compression)
- Add data augmentation during training (pitch shifting, time stretching, noise addition)
- Use adaptive normalization based on audio characteristics

**Expected Impact**: 10-20% improvement in robustness and consistency

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Tracks 1, 3, 8)
- Test original audio vs. drum stems
- Evaluate single-method approaches
- Implement basic preprocessing improvements

### Phase 2: Advanced Models (Tracks 2, 4, 7)
- Implement LSTM + self-attention model
- Develop specialized ensemble models
- Improve spectral feature extraction

### Phase 3: Advanced Techniques (Tracks 5, 6)
- Multi-scale temporal analysis
- Real-time few-shot learning

## Testing Protocol

For each validated track:
1. **Implementation**: Create the improvement with clear logging
2. **Testing**: Run conversion with `--title "TestName_TrackN"` format
3. **Validation**: Compare results in DTXMania
4. **Metrics**: Log accuracy, confidence scores, and processing time
5. **Docker**: Ensure builds work correctly with no fallback errors

## Expected Outcomes

- **Best Case**: 50-60% improvement in overall accuracy (combining multiple tracks)
- **Realistic**: 30-40% improvement with 2-3 successful tracks
- **Minimum**: 20% improvement with at least one successful track

## Next Steps

Please review and validate the tracks you'd like to implement. I recommend starting with **Track 1** (Original Audio) and **Track 3** (Single Method) as they're the quickest to implement and can provide immediate insights.
